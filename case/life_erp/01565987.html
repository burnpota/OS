제목  : RHEL HA Cluster Configuration Inspection
</font></b><br><br>======================<br><b>사전문의<br></b><br>This case was generated at the request of a user on this account through the RHEL High Availability Cluster Inspector in the Red Hat Customer Portal:<br><br>https://access.redhat.com/labs/clustercheck/<br><br>Soon, this case will be populated with a new comment that contains the results from the automated inspection process that is currently being performed on the sosreports provided by the user that initiated this request.<br><br>Those results may contain recommendations on improving the stability, behavior, or performance of the cluster in question, which you may then choose whether or not to implement.  Some of these results may highlight critical errors within the configuration, or aspects of the deployed cluster that may fall outside of the scope of support from Red Hat.  Red Hat recommends understanding and following the guidelines provided within these results whenever possible, but the administrators of this cluster must ultimately decide what is appropriate for that particular deployment.<br><br>Red Hat's High Availability and Resilient Storage experts are standing by to help you understand and make use of the results provided by this inspection.  This case will be placed in an archived state upon completion of the inspection, but you can always simply add a new comment to the case after that point to reactivate it in order to initiate further discussion of the results, ask questions, or raise concerns to Red Hat's cluster specialists.<br><br>NOTE: The results provided by this app do not confer or suggest any official approval, guarantee, or statement of supportability on the part of Red Hat for the deployment under inspection.  This tool is merely intended as an aid to customers in deploying their clusters according to Red Hat's recommended practices, but ultimately the responsibility lies with the customer in confirming a deployment is suitable for its intended purposes.<br>=======================<br><b>상태 : Closed</b><br><b>제품명  : Other</b><br><b>버젼  : Unknown</b><br><b>계정 번호  : 5251314</b><br><b>심각도  : 4 (Low)</b><br><enhancedSLA>false</enhancedSLA><contactIsPartner>false</contactIsPartner><tags/><br><br><comment id="a0aA000000G1QfYIAV"><br>======================<br><b>생성계정 : HAN, JINKOO</b><br><b>생성날짜 : 2016-01-14T05:45:21Z</b><br><b>마지막 답변자 : HAN, JINKOO</b><br><b>마지막 수정 일자 : 2016-01-14T05:45:21Z</b><br><br>안녕하세요,<br>Red Hat Technical Account Manager 한진구 입니다.<br><br>유선상으로 이야기 드렸듯이, 현재 sosreport가 3rd-party 의 보안모듈로 인하여 정상적이지 못한듯 합니다.<br><br>3rd-party 모듈을 내리고 다시 생성하여 Architecture Review를 요청햊시기 바랍니다<br>======================<br>감사합니다<br><br><publishedDate>2016-01-14T05:45:21Z</publishedDate><createdByType>Associate</createdByType><br>======================<br></comments><br>
